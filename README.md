# Task Management API

This project implements a RESTful API for a simple task management system, providing features such as user authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, data persistence, input validation, and real-time data streaming through WebSocket.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implemented using JWT tokens for secure access to API endpoints.
- **CRUD Operations**: Endpoints provided for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **Data Persistence**: Task data is stored in a [database of your choice].
- **Input Validation**: Input data is validated to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Real-time updates are streamed through WebSocket.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- [Database of your choice]
- WebSocket (for real-time streaming)
